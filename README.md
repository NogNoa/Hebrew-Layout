# Hebrew-Layout
Alternative keyboard layouts for the Hebrew Script

Goal:
To make 3 different keybaoard layouts: Psantran, Kanar, and SI 1452.
SI 1452 is the most similar to the traditional Hebrew PC Keyboard. Harmonisiong the use of punctuation with Latin Keyboards, and as a result moving the ף, ת, ץ, and ן keys to a different place. 
Psantran does this sligtly differently and also move the niqqud to the upper case of the home row. It doesn't feature Capital Latin cherecters on the upper case of the layout (hence requiring a switch to a latin Keyboard)
Kanar is a more radical change. moving the final letters to the upper case of their regular variants. along with other niqquds and letter varients, really utilising the keyboard to write in Hebrew.
